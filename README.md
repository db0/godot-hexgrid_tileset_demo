# Godot Tileset-Hexgrid demo	

This simple demo simply displays how to connect a hexgrid according [to this guide](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/implementation.html) to a Godot tilemap (like in the hex demo in the asset store)

Hex code taken from: https://github.com/romlok/godot-gdhexgrid and modified to use internal Godot functions. Please check that repository for usage of the included libraries.

Tileset created quicky via GIMP for purposes of this demo. 

## Demo Usage

   * Highlighted hex will display coordinates in both Godot grid and in Hex Vector3 (i.e "cube" format). 
   * Left-clicking on a hex, will convert it to a water tile
   * Right-Clicking on a hex will convert all its neighbours to mountain tiles.
